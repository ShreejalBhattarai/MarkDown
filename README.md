Hi, I'm Shreejal. I'm an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student with a strong interest in embedded systems, deep learning and RF applications. I'm particularly passionate about integrating vision-based models into edge platforms. I am very open to chat about hobby projects, politics and Cricket!
