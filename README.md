Hi, I'm Shreejal. I'm an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student with a strong interest in embedded systems and deep learning. I'm particularly passionate about integrating vision-based models into edge platforms like NVIDIA's Jetson Nano or Jetson Orin. I am very open to chat about hobby projects, politics and Cricket!
